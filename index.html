	<p><strong>Some of the flowers capture the imagination like no other. The beauty of these flowers makes them iconic. When we see them, we are transported to a garden wedding, tropical destination, or secret forest. Yet most of the flowers can grow in the typical suburban landscape as a hardy perennial or patio specimen, and some are even easy to grow from seed.</strong></p>

	<h3> The Orchid</h3>
		<p>Take the inherent beauty of the orchid, and add fantastic speckling and unusual anatomy, and you will recognize one of the dozen or so species of the Zygopetalum genus of orchids. Unlike many orchids, the zygopetalum is also very fragrant. Grow in partial shade in humid conditions, and protect from hot summer temperatures and freezing temperatures. A hanging basket under the dappled shade of a tree provides the best lighting conditions for the zygopetalum orchid.</p>

	<h3>English Rose</h3>
		<p>English roses like the 'Abraham Darby' variety shown here are revered for their large blooms packed with petals and old world fragrance. Many of the most beloved English roses (Rosa) come from the David Austin breeding program, where roses undergo an eight year trial program to identify the most outstanding garden varieties. Grow these zone 5-9 plants in full sun in rich loam, and fertilize once in spring and once in summer.</p>
